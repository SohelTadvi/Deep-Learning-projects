# Deep Learning Project: Image Classification with CNNs  

This deep learning project focuses on building a robust image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to develop an end-to-end pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.  

We begin by acquiring a large dataset of labeled images from sources like ImageNet, CIFAR-10, or custom datasets. Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model generalization. The CNN model is designed with multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout, and activation functions like ReLU. We leverage TensorFlow or PyTorch to train the model, optimizing it with techniques like transfer learning, fine-tuning, and hyperparameter tuning.  

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score help assess model performance. We visualize training curves, confusion matrices, and feature maps to interpret the model’s learning process. The trained model is deployed using Flask or FastAPI, allowing real-time image classification via a web interface or API.  

This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in automating image recognition tasks, making it applicable to healthcare, security, and retail industries. The final deliverable is a deployed application showcasing the model’s real-world capabilities.
